# CoriandoloRadio
This respository contains source code for Coriandolo Radio protocol; it also contains documentation, "wrappers" and example code.

This source code will execute on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF51 processor (any device in that family).  A software version is planned for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 processor.  Versions for other CPU/Radio combinations are possible, but not planned at this time.

The software was developed and tested using the Keil IDE.  A free version for Cortex-M0 processors is available from Keil.
